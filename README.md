# Lego Builder

Simple mobile-first concept app, designed to help my son learn to build his favourite things (mainly robots and trucks) with Lego Duplo.

## Introduction

My son is an early learner. He can't follow (not quite yet anyway!) the sequence diagrams for building his favourite Duplo sets. We build together, but I also noticed how engaged he became when he saw a stop-motion animation of Lego being built. I built this simple app to help him to learn and build by himself and for when we can't build and learn together.   

## The App

Lego Builder is a single-page mobile-first website. It uses full-page scrolling implemented with CSS3. Animation is implemented *old-skool* with sprite sheets and JavaScript.

Please feel free to adapt and improve Lego Builder if, for any reason, it's something that has caught your eye.  

## Built with

* HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. No fancy frameworks.
* [The fantastic Clicky Bricks font](https://www.fontspace.com/clicky-bricks-font-f29766)
